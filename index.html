        <p>Hi! My name is João Pedro Nardy, but you can just call me Nardy. I’m 24 years old and I live in Bragança
            Paulista, SP. I love reading, writing, exercising, and hiking. I’m also a cat lover, although I don’t have
            any pets at the moment.
            Recently, I returned from my mission in Huancayo, Perú (the picture on the right was taken there).
            I aspire to become a software developer working from Brazil, and I hope to use my knowledge in technology to
            create programs that are useful in daily life and help people with everyday tasks in an efficient way. I am
            grateful for the opportunity to be part of BYU Pathway Worldwide, where I can enhance my skills and learn
            many new concepts through this course.
        </p>
